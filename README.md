# Overview

The `compare.py` Python script compares two different output files and displays whether they match. You can use this script to compare your own produced log.txt file with the sample result provided by the instructors.

This repository contains all the result files provided by the instructors.

To use this script, make sure Python is installed in your system, and then execute the following command:

`# python compare.py base.txt log.txt`

Where `base.txt` is the result file provided by the instructors that will serve as the base of comparison, and `log.txt` is the log file generated by you running your algorithm.
